We're going to be learning JavaScript in this course to build some basic
interactive websites! JavaScript (JS) has the following syntax:

```js{1,4,6-7}
export default { // Highlighted
  data () {
    return {
      msg: `Highlighted!
      This line isn't highlighted,
      but this and the next 2 are.`,
      motd: 'VitePress is awesome',
      lorem: 'ipsum',
    }
  }
}
```
